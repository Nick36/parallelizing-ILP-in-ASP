There are two output modes
1. Human mode (default)

2. Machine mode
./aspal.py --machine ...

There are three mode of execution.

1. Find one solution (default)
    ./aspal.py ...
In this case an iteration is performed on the depth of the rules. The default settings are used as upper bounds.

2. Find all solutions
    ./aspal.py -a ...
In this case the given (or default) settings are used.

3. Find the optimal solution
    ./aspal.py -o ...
In this case an iteration is performed on the depth of the rules. The default settings are used as upper bounds.

Additional notes:

 All files with extension *.lp are example files, except for s.lp, which is needed by aspal.py - do not delete it!

 Execute a file with clingo:
 ./clingo -n 0 <filename.lp> for all solutions with no optimization statements or just one optimal solution
 
 ./clingo --opt-all <filename.lp> for all optimal solutions
 
 Execute a file with ASPAL:
 ./aspal.py -f <filename.lp>
 
 ./aspal.py -of <filename.lp> for optimal solutions only
 
 Execute a file with parallelizer:
 python parallelizer.py <filename.lp>
 
 python parallelizer.py --optimal  <filename.lp> for optimal solutions only
 
 Note that parallelizing a logic program, while producing little overhead, 
 only yields better results for demanding tasks with many dependencies 
 between head mode declaration predicates.
